Having fun with dotfiles.

## :beer: Brewfile

Using a brew file to install dependencies on mac. A bunch of well-known command line tools that help me at work, some dependencies I need for neovim and some apps I usually use. 

## Scripts

```sh
# Links all the configuration files 
# Note all neovim configuration is in a private repo
install.sh

# Sets up the terminal
# aka oh my zsh
terminal.sh

# Adds extensions to VS Code
vscode_extensions.sh
```
